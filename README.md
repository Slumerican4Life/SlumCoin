## ⚡ What Is SlumCoin?

SlumCoin is a decentralized, community-owned digital currency forked from Dogecoin and reimagined as a chain of resilience, rebellion, and raw creative power. Inspired by the spirit of the streets and the genius in the gutter, SlumCoin empowers underdogs and overlooked visionaries to move money, share value, and ride the wave of true decentralization.

- ⚡ Based on the battle-tested Dogecoin (Litecoin-based)
- ☠️ Rebranded with a black & gold fist gripping lightning — no cute dogs here
- 🔥 Designed for low fees, high speed, real community energy

## 💀 Who’s It For?

SlumCoin is for:
- Digital hustlers and **meme smiths**
- Artists, poets, and **culture warriors**
- Outlaws, underdogs, **the broke and brilliant**
- Rebels building empires in the ruins

This isn’t a crypto for billionaires.  
It’s for the ones clawing their way out of digital dust — and bringing the fire with them.
